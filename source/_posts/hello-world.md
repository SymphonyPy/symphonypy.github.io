title: Hello World
---
So this is gonna be the first post of my blog. Actually, I've set up a blog before, but I just wrote one post(or say, some sentences) because I was(or "am" or "will be") too lazy. 

Then why do I set up this again? Did I eat too lot? Indeed, I am almost 5 kg heavier than I was 2 months ago. But this is not the reason. 

The actual reason is that I just watched a vlog. The vlogger is also a developer, he said the reason to be a vlogger is to develop his express ability. You know, developers usually don't need to communicate a lot with others. And me myself is not good at socializing and expressing. Thus, I find it very important for me to conciously grow this ability. It'll benefit me not only for work but also for my whole life.

Also, it'll be fun to record something. I just read a sentence, "recording is like talking to myself in the future". Hey, me, how are you there?

The last reason is not that important but I need to mention: to practice my English. Maybe this is not that useful for the work right now, but this'll be very important when it's needed.

It's 00:02, and it's Spring Festival's Eve now. I need to take a shower and go to bed. And there's nothing more for this post. That's it.

It's going to be 2020 in any perspectives. In 2020, I wanna be an excellent people!
