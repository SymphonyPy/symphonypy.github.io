It's been a long time since the last post. Many things happened and it's time to write them down in case I forget them.

The first and the biggest thing is the COVID-19. Many people died for it. Also many people stood out and fought against it. Sometimes, I think I'm kind of egoist(I just googled it), I just focus on what will benefit me regardless of others. But also sometimes I want to be a hero, I want to be the one who saves others and be a shiny torch in others'lives even for seconds. I appreciate them, I admire them, and I wanna be one of them.

And because of the epidemic, I had to work at home. Thank god that I'd just work for not long time, I didn't have much work to do and I wasn't needed to any meetings or anything else. I didn't have to work till very late. However, because of staying in bed all day, my weight kept increasing, about 5 kg...

Then came to April and May, nothing big happened. I remember that I sent my mom a robot to swap the floor as present for Mother's Day, and a Huawei pad to my father for Father's Day. It felt not bad to use my own money to buy something for my parents. I forgot other things, maybe I should have check commits on git hhhhh.

At the beginning of July, I went to Shenzhen with my colleagues, so damn hot there. And on July 10th, I finally graudated! I got my diploma through the fence and the teacher who gave me that, it was the one who notified me about that thing. Oh I bought a road bike, and riding is an acceptable sport for me and I can ride to work and park it in an underground garage, absolutely worth the money!

In August, or in September, I finished reading C++ primer, finally. The next one is Effective C++. It's thinner and smaller. I've read about one quarter of it so far. The content is not very deep, but explains something that I didn't understand when reading C++ primer. Feels not bad. Hope I can finish it in short time.

I've said that I would be an excellent people in 2020. AppArently, I didn't make it. I didn't lose my weight, I didn't read a lot of books, I didn't learn as much as I expected. It's so hard to accomplish the flags...

I don't know what to write but this seems different from how I imagine before. But I think I can get used to it, I mean things are always different from how we think, that's the normal thing.

It's late, and I need to work tomorrow. Enought for today. See you in the next post. Hope that's not too far from now.
