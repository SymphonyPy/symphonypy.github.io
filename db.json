Indeed, I am almost 5 kg heavier than I was 2 months ago. But this is not the reason. </p>\n<p>The actual reason is that I just watched a vlog. The vlogger is also a developer, he said the reason to be a vlogger is to develop his express ability. You know, developers usually don’t need to communicate a lot with others. And me myself is not good at socializing and expressing. Thus, I find it very important for me to conciously grow this ability. It’ll benefit me not only for work but also for my whole life.</p>\n<p>Also, it’ll be fun to record something. I just read a sentence, “recording is like talking to myself in the future”. Hey, me, how are you there?</p>\n<p>The last reason is not that important but I need to mention: to practice my English. Maybe this is not that useful for the work right now, but this’ll be very important when it’s needed.</p>\n<p>It’s 00:02, and it’s Spring Festival’s Eve now. I need to take a shower and go to bed. And there’s nothing more for this post. That’s it.</p>\n<p>It’s going to be 2020 in any perspectives. In 2020, I wanna be an excellent people!</p>\n"},{"title":"Long time no see","date":"2020-10-19T15:41:32.000Z","_content":"It's been a long time since the last post. Many things happened and it's time to write them down in case I forget them.\n\nThe first and the biggest thing is the COVID-19. Many people died for it.

Thank god that I'd just work for not long time, I didn't have much work to do and I wasn't needed to any meetings or anything else. I didn't have to work till very late. However, because of staying in bed all day, my weight kept increasing, about 5 kg...\n\nThen came to April and May, nothing big happened. I remember that I sent my mom a robot to swap the floor as present for Mother's Day, and a Huawei pad to my father for Father's Day. It felt not bad to use my own money to buy something for my parents. I forgot other things, maybe I should have check commits on git hhhhh.\n\nAt the beginning of July, I went to Shenzhen with my colleagues, so damn hot there. And on July 10th, I finally graudated!

The next one is Effective C++. It's thinner and smaller. I've read about one quarter of it so far. The content is not very deep, but explains something that I didn't understand when reading C++ primer. Feels not bad.
